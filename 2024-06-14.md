## Current Tasks

- test wheel.me web API
- brainstorm other needed features for Jack Stand Orchestrator

## Notes and Observations

1. The wheel.me API, as expected, gives us limited control of the robots and provides no
support for pruning lidar data, changing footprint, or editing safety features of the 
device. This means that using the wheel.me devices for the various robots that are 
needed for the truss system will be virtually impossible. The only case in which they 
could potentially work is if the mobile bases are each given one expressed purpose and 
all corresponding hardware for its tasks are permantly integrated onto it. Furthermore 
the hardware would not be able to protrude outside of the mobile base's perimeter since 
it can act as an obstruction to the wheel.me's sensors.

2. After talking with Barrett, it seems as though we won't be using the wheel.mes for
the truss construction system. So intermodes it is. 

3. I will need to do a few final tests with the orchestrator to ensure it can perform 
fine movements. Especially if it is coordinating several stands to move a member a small
amount. I will need to record these tests so I should not perform them too quickly.
