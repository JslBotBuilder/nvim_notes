## Current Tasks

- Test protections for JS controller axes to prevent high speeds and accels
- Move on to STM controll scheme or mobile robots

## Notes and Observations

1. I was able to probe the uart lines on one of the Jack Stands to measure the time delay
between uart messages sent to the STM by the Pi. I verified that the messages are sent
almost consecutively, having only about 5.2 ms between the last byte of one move message
and the last byte of the next move message (the messages are sent consecutivley). The 
only reason this time difference even exists is because of the UART response sent from
the STM to the Pi in between move commands.

2. The method for preventing the theta axis on the JS from breaking was successful. 
The stand can now be freely controlled with default speed parameters without fear of
damage/malfunction of motor drivers.

There is only one problem now. The math for coordinating the x and y axes with the theta
axis is off. For certain motions, the theta axis finishes it's motion much faster than 
the two translational axes. This is most likely because I'm assuming the x and y will
not be able to ramp up to full speed when the 200 mm/s check fails. This assumption is
wrong, since there are many cases in which the theta axis will successfully ramp up to
its constant max speed. This means the x and y axes must match this behavior, even if 
the motion they are performing is relatively small.
