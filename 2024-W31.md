## Weekly Overview

This week will be focused on fixing the jack stand planner algorithm. Hopefully fixing
the equations will help the planner perform better.

## Primary Goals

1. Improve Jack Stand Planner optimization algorithm1. Fix truss reader
2. Finish Plate Planner algorithm

## Secondary Goals

1. Update truss reader documentation
2. Improve code health of suffering repos

## High Level Notes

- Talking with Trevor revealed that I read the equations improperly. The inner force
equation will need to be used to solve for deflection instead of force. This will make
the criteria for the inner equation to be that the deflection at the point being solved
needs to be greater than or equal to 0. The second equation was also completely
improperly copied. I will need to correct it.

## Current Untransfered information

- Added heartbeat publisher to Jack Stand Controller [[2024-05-14]]
- Orchstrator features and changes
- Jack Stand Planner changes (changing what is considered a deflection point)
- Truss Reader changes (gathering member type info and fixing intersection point bug)
- Jack Stand Planner model and constraint changes

## Transfered Information

## Final Notes and Analysis

This week saw the finalization of the improvements (or in the case of the jackstand
planner, downgrades) to the planning software for the truss system. Some fixes will be
needed for the jackstand_planner in the future but for the time being, we will leave the
planner to it's current working implementation. The plate access visualizer is working 
and, for now, should give us a good idea of what trusses the press will support. The 
documentation for the jackstand_planner and truss reader will need to be updated in 
light of the changes made to both. Other than that, it would seem as though I will be 
FINALLY moving on to working with the mobile robots. I will need to structure the way in
which I try and figure them out as I can easily trick myself into treating it as a 
daunting task if I don't.
