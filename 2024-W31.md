## Weekly Overview

This week will be focused on fixing the jack stand planner algorithm. Hopefully fixing
the equations will help the planner perform better.

## Primary Goals

1. Improve Jack Stand Planner optimization algorithm1. Fix truss reader
2. Finish Plate Planner algorithm

## Secondary Goals

1. Update truss reader documentation
2. Improve code health of suffering repos

## High Level Notes

- Talking with Trevor revealed that I read the equations improperly. The inner force
equation will need to be used to solve for deflection instead of force. This will make
the criteria for the inner equation to be that the deflection at the point being solved
needs to be greater than or equal to 0. The second equation was also completely
improperly copied. I will need to correct it.

## Current Untransfered information

- Added heartbeat publisher to Jack Stand Controller [[2024-05-14]]
- Orchstrator features and changes
- Jack Stand Planner changes (changing what is considered a deflection point)
- Truss Reader changes (gathering member type info and fixing intersection point bug)
- Jack Stand Planner model and constraint changes
