## Weekly Overview

After finally getting close to finishing developement on the Jack Stands and their 
associated software, Barrett thought it necessary to gather more data on what kind of 
trusses we can build with various footprints of the press robot. He primarily wanted to
see if the wheel.mes could be used as the primary carrier for the press. Though I doubt
these robots are suited to the task, I agree that more concrete data will certainly help
understand the footprint requirements of the press robot better. This was and addition
Trevor had wanted for the Jack Stand Planner a while back so it is certainly high time
that I add it, as well as make much needed updates to the planner. This will be my 
primary task for this week. 

I can't forget to do angle accuracy tests on the Jack Stand Orchestrator. As annoying as 
this is, I won't have any data pointing to the stand's capability to perform small angle
movements unless I run these.

## Primary Goals

1. Perform angle accuracy tests on Jack Stand Orchestrator
2. Update and Revamp Jack Stand Planner

## Secondary Goals

## High Level Notes

## Current Untransfered information

- Added heartbeat publisher to Jack Stand Controller [[2024-05-14]]
- Orchstrator features and changes
- Jack Stand Planner changes (changing what is considered a deflection point)
- Truss Reader changes (gathering member type info and fixing intersection point bug)
- Jack Stand Planner model and constraint changes

## Transfered Information

## Final Notes and Analysis

This week was primarily a planning week for the Jack Stand Planner. Since I don't have
nail plate information, this means I need to wait on Colin to give me the final word on
what information we're capable of getting and what we need to produce ourselves. Because
of this, I've been relagated to finding other issues in the Jack Stand Planner to solve.
This unfortunately opened the major can of worms that is all the factors that will need
to be taken into account when planning. I'll need to redo the objective function of the
planner to include these factors and update the constraints I will need to impose to 
allow the problem to be solved.
