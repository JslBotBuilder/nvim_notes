## Weekly Overview

This week may very well mark the last of the software work that will be done on the 
JS stands and the JS orchestrator for a while. As of now everything operates smoothly
enough that I may be able to move on to mobile robots by the end of the week.

I do have a tighter week ahead of me though, so I'll need to make every second count.

I'll dedicate some time to trying to hunt down the error that causes the remaining time
discrepancy between the axis square waves. The main goal is to finish orhcestration
testing first. I believe I'll need to make one final feature for the orchestrator. I
need the speeds and accels that the stands use (at least when supporting the same 
member) to be proportional to where the stand is from the member's center of mass. I 
also need thoses speeds to be based of the individual motor that will need to move the 
furthest. This is so that member movement will not damage the wood or the Jack Stands
moving it.

## Primary Goals
- Refine documenting workflow
- Make task rotation for productivity improvement
- Test JS Orchestrator with new JS firmware
- Edit orchestrator to perfrom speed scalling for the Jack Stands
- Investigate remaining source of error axis control on JS firmware

## Secondary Goals
- Make plans for Jack Stand firmware architecture changes
- Get back to mobile robots
- Edit branch of Jack stand firmware to work with Matthew's JS board

## High Level Notes

## Current Untransfered information

- Setting micro step resolution on STM from pi software, [[2024-04-15]]
- Adding protections for theta axis in JS controller, [[2024-04-24]]
- Changed how the JS controller calculates the correct speeds and accels for axis
coordination
- Changing how TIM5 on the STM32 is used to control the stepping pulses
- Updated documentation on Jack Stand Controller

## Transfered Information



## Final Notes and Analysis

Though a couple setbacks hindered orchestrator testing. The firmware improvements
performed on the Jack Stands microcontroller were a major step in finalizing the Jack
Stands.
