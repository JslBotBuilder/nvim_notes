## Current Tasks

- run final angle test on Jack Stand Orchestrator
- plan out Jack Stand Planner software changes and modifications

## Notes and Observations

1. After having many dicussions with Barrett and Trevor, it is clear that the
considerations the current Jack Stand Planner takes into account are far too simplified.
I will need to consider more than just proximity to deflection points to ensure that a
truss is properly supported by jack stands for a build to be successful. Placing the 
stands in an optimal location for imperfections in the wood to be corrected is another
factor the planner will need to take into account. Another element is what role the
joints on a member play in determining the placement of the stands. I currently do not 
know what approach to take in deciding this, all I know is that the current method is 
not sufficient.

2. Trevor says that almost all wood needed for a truss can be supported by, at most, two
Jack Stands. This runs completely counter to the current approach the planner uses to 
place stands. Whether a member should be supported by more than two stands should be
determined by what quality lumber can be accepted for that specific member. This is a
complicated function but I plan to simplify it in the following way: In the case of a 
member needing more than one stand to be supported, if the flexibility of the member (
what percentile of wood can be accepted for the member) is greatly improved (currently 
by 5%) by adding a third stand, then the third stand will be added. This is a bit tricky
to implement on an integer solver but it's worth giving a shot.
