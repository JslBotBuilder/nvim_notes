## Weekly Overview

This week will primarilly be focused on fixing the various bugs introduced by the
improvements to the truss_reader, as well as beginning the implementation of the truss
joint characterization. There will be a couple loose ends that will need to be tied as
well.

## Primary Goals

1. Fix truss reader
2. Talk to Jack about plate robot accessibility algorithm
3. Talk to wheel.me about new footprint and mapping implementations
4. Improve Jack Stand Planner optimization algorithm1. Fix truss reader

## Secondary Goals

1. Update truss reader documentation
2. Improve code health of suffering repos
3. Mark repos set to me merged into monorepo

## High Level Notes

## Current Untransfered information

- Added heartbeat publisher to Jack Stand Controller [[2024-05-14]]
- Orchstrator features and changes
- Jack Stand Planner changes (changing what is considered a deflection point)
- Truss Reader changes (gathering member type info and fixing intersection point bug)
- Jack Stand Planner model and constraint changes

## Transfered Information

## Final Notes and Analysis

Unfortunately getting to talk to the people I needed to has been a fairly slow process.
I'll have to talk to both Jack and the engineer from wheel.me next week. I did, however,
fix the main issues that were causing the truss reader not output usable information. 
There were many issues. The main one, however, was my edge intersection implementation.
Even though I could've sworn I followed the cross produce algorithm to a T, it came up 
with absurd results. I changed it to a more deterministic approach that can be easilly
implemented.
