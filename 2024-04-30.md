## Current Tasks

- Narrow down JS axis coordination issue
- Study time-optimal control
- Create time optimal control algorithm for JS
- Implement fix for JS axis coordination issue

## Notes and Observations

1. I'm reverting the changes I made yesterday as they broke the stand and caused me
significant headache.

2. I'm still waiting on the robot textbook so I'll try and read up online about time
optimal control for now. I'll try and put my findings here. I will most certainly want
to add these to obsidian.

## Accomplished Goals

- Study time-optimal control
- Implement fix for JS axis coordination issue
