## Current Tasks

- figure out how to make occupancy map for intermode mobile robots
- run accuracy tests on Jack Stand Orchestrator implementations
- document and record accuracy tests

## Notes and Observations

1. Ann didn't exactly give me a straight answer as to whether the orin board on the 
intermode is supposed to not boot while the charger is connected. However, she didn't
seem that concerned about it.

2. It would appear that updates to the intermode software did in fact happen while I was
working on the Jack Stands. I'll have to wait for Ann to send me whatever updates were
made.

## Accomplished Goals

- run accuracy tests on Jack Stand Orchestrator implementations
