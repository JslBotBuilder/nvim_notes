## Current Tasks

- run final angle test on Jack Stand Orchestrator
- add optimal Jack Stand placement constraint to Jack Stand Planner
- add nail plate visualization to Jack Stand Planner

## Notes and Observations

1. I've recieved a different file type: the .tps file. This supposedly contains all the
nail plate information that the laser guidance systems use to outline where plates are
to be placed. If I can get this file consistently, it can potentially fill the gap of 
information that currently exists for the system.

2. TPS file data layout:
```
START [truss name]
# bearing [bearing point] (repeat for number of bearing points)
# boardheight [board height]
# quantity [quantity]
;!# [comment] (repeat for number of comments)
|[Member/Nail Plate format (denoted by line)]
|[Member/Plate id] [number of coordinates] [board projected text]
|; [Material comment (sometimes present)]
|[corner point coordinate (x, y pair)] (repeat for number of coordinates)
(repeat member for each member in truss)
(repeat WHOLE structure above for each truss stored in file)
EOD
```

Letter codes for Member/Plate IDs:
- W -> web
- T -> top chord
- B -> bottom chord
- E -> end vertical
- F -> filler member
- P -> nail plate
- O -> other

All items preceded by a # are optional information and may not be present in all tps 
files. All items preceded by a ; are comments and are generally ignored by software that
reads these files, however, they may very well contain useful information.

The "quantity" field says how many of this particular truss must be built for the house
to be constructed.

## Accomplished Goals

Progress was made on nail plate visualizer feature of Jack Stand Planner but was not 
finished.
