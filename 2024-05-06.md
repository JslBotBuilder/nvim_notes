## Current Tasks

- Invesitgate source of remaining axis control error
- Test JS orchestrator

## Notes and Observations

1. After looking into the square waves of the JS controller for several accel values, I
have found a separate bug in the firmware. The accel and deccel times as well as the 
starting and ending speed values don't match. Because of the way I determine when to 
deccelerate, I can only imagine this bug is the cause of poor implementation of the ramp
class and ramp update methods. I will try to look and see if I can pinpoint what about 
my implementation is causing this, but I won't spend too much time on it.

## Accomplished Goals

- Invesitgate source of remaining axis control error
