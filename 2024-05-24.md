## Current Tasks

- Implement speed scalling on Jack Stand Orchestrator
- Assembled the rest of the Jack Stand breakout boards
- Test New Jack Stand Circuitry

## Notes and Observations

1. I seem to have narrowed down the issue of the Jack Stands to the encoders. However,
further tests need to be done to see what exactly is happening.

2. I will run a test in which I check the encoder feed by manually moving an axis and 
then checking it's encoder value.

Theta Axis: 

Moved Amount | Encoder Reading

1 turn          \~200 steps
2 turns         \~400 steps
3 turns         \~600 steps

X Axis:

Moved Amount | Encoder Reading

1 turn          0 steps
2 turns         0 steps
3 turns         0 steps

Y Axis:

Moved Amount | Encoder Reading

1 turn          \~200 steps
2 turns         \~400 steps
3 turns         \~600 steps

3. It would appear that one of the encoders was faulty and was not giving me any
readings. This was on Jack Stand 2. I have replaced it with another encoder from a 
different stand.

4. It would seem I've also introduced a position calculation error. I should figure out
where I've done this.
