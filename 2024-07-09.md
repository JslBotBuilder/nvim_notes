## Current Tasks

- add optimal Jack Stand placement constraint to Jack Stand Planner
- add nail plate visualization to Jack Stand Planner

## Notes and Observations

1. After talking with Barrett, I have a couple new tasks on my list. Firstly the Jack
Stand Orchestrator test was sufficient for validating the accuracy of the software. This
means that developement is done for now!! The rest of the tasks are noted below.

2. I need to develop a separate optimizer for determining if the press will be able to
reach the joints of a truss. I should talk with Jack Hall about developing the solution.
Apparently he's solved a similar issue before.

3. I need to contact one of the engineers at wheel.me about a hack they can perform on 
the base footprint to support protrusions from the base. It's unclear what they mean by 
this or what the implications will be for control and mapping but I need to find out.

4. I need to talk to Matthew about the ABB Elbow electronic hardware. I will be setting
it up for team 4 and 5. 

5. Elbow board wiring:

- one board has a 20 pin connector that's backwards
- must create a new wiring harness that's backwards to fix
- be sure to label it
