## Weekly Overview

I'm hoping to get good information from Colin this week concerning the truss files that 
we need to get nail plate data. Until then I'll still try and perform the objective 
function changes to take into account optimal deflecting points to correct wood from. I
also need to perform the final Jack Stand Orchestrator test before Friday. Not doing so
may not look good for me. 

## Primary Goals

1. Perform angle accuracy tests on Jack Stand Orchestrator
2. Update and Revamp Jack Stand Planner

## Secondary Goals
