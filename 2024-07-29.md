## Current Tasks

- add optimal Jack Stand placement constraint to Jack Stand Planner
- finish Plate Planner algortihm
- call Jack about algorithm for press robot reach characterization

## Notes and Observations

1. Meeting notes:
    
    - Camera selection is still happening, but the camera will depend on the placement of
    the camera on the press.

    - The placement of the camera is still planned to be directly in front of the press 
    jaw.

    - I can work with Adam on the camera integration with the software anytime. 


## Accomplished Goals

- call Jack about algorithm for press robot reach characterization
- finish Plate Planner algortihm
