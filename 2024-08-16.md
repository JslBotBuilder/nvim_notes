## Current Tasks

- get lidars working on intermode mobile base

## Notes and Observations

1. Speed Demon notes:
    - callgrind is instrumentation that is heavy and gives info for all software that 
    runs within a program. This makes it difficult to find desired information and may 
    include exterior threading that does not relate to the 
    - removing the nagles algorithm implementation reduces the time that ros2 takes to
    send simple low data packages
    - Ros2 has it's own profilling tool. This may be useful for seeing what process take
    the most time and is most likely the simplest to implement
    - the main objective now is use the best profiling tool to define the slowest code
    and processes
