## Current Tasks

- Add heartbeat to Jack Stand Controller
- Implement speed scalling on Jack Stand Orchestrator

## Notes and Observations

1. For the speed scaling on the Jack Stand Orchestrator, I plan to employ the same 
technique used on the Jack Stand Controller to coordinate the individual axes: scaling
the speed and accel values by the ratio of the stand we are moving over the stand with
the largest cartesian distance movement. Assuming the Jack Stands supporting the memeber
have the same lead screw configuration this should work fine. Though I may have to 
employ a method to pull the lead screw configuration of the Jack Stands if the pitches 
are too different.

## Accomplished Goals

- Add hearbeat to Jack Stand Controller
