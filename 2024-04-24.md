## Current Tasks

- Implement protections for JS controller axes to prevent high speeds and accels
- Move on to STM controll scheme or mobile robots

## Notes and Observations

1. In order to implement protections for the theta axis against impossible speeds and
accelerations, I will have to define a set velocity that the theta axis is not allowed 
to exceed during motion planning. If the theta axis would have to exceed this speed in
order to finish it's motion at the same time as the x and y axes then the program will
use and alternate method for calculating the final speeds and accelerations for the
axes. This alternate method will be to simply set the theta stage's acceleration and 
speed to the ones designated by the move command and reverse the calculation used to
determine the theta stages speed information from the x and y's speed information.

In other words, if the rotational axis cannot keep up with the speed of the x and y axes
than instead of the rotational(theta) speed being determined by the translational
(x and y) speed, the translational speed will be determined by the rotational speed.

We can simplify the checking whether the final calculated theta speed would excceed the
max speed threshold by checking how much time it would take for the translation axes to
reach their goal. This would be an estimate but for small translational movements it is
a sufficient approximation.
