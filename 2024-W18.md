# Weekly Notes

## Format

I still need to make the most of these weekly notes. I've decided to have the weekly 
focused on keeping track of information for the week and whether it has been transfered
to more permanent locations. This will hopfully help me keep the software documentation
up to date and give me an easy way of finding info that hasn't been transfered.

I will be using the following format to accomplish this for now:
- Weekly Overview
- Primary Goals
- Secondary Goals
- High Level Notes
- Current Untransfered information
- Transfered information
- Final notes and analysis

## Weekly Overview

Progress has been tough as of late and I think the reasoning is clear. I need a more
efficient method of performing and documenting work. A major task for this week will
entail testing new daily and weekly proccedures for documenting information. This will
hopefully help me quickly shift mindset as soon as I come to work. Using my past self to
brief my future self may be the key to filling so many of the gaps that I need to keep
the flow.

This week marks the first week of a recent pace change at the company. This will 
obviously affect how much time I have to dedicate to the truss system, so it is
imperitive that I make the most of the time I have. Developing a productivity pattern 
that can allow my mind a break from certain forms of work by accomplishing other tasks
is another idea I want to try. I'll try to make a rotation in the high level notes.

Outside of this, the tasks that must be accomplished this week are getting the Jack 
Stands production ready. They are far too close to be taking as long as they have.
Debugging the root causes of their final issues needs to speed up if I'm to ever finish
This system.

## Primary Goals
- Make documenting workflow
- Make task rotation for productivity improvement
- Fix Jack Stand axis coordination issue
- Learn how to operate panel system

## Secondary Goals
- Make plans for Jack Stand firmware architecture changes
- Get back to mobile robots
- Edit branch of Jack stand firmware to work with Matthew's JS board

## High Level Notes

1. I can't think of much at the moment, so the task rotation I plan on using this week
will consist only of the tasks that need to get done. It will be better in the future to 
have motor time to think about this, but the current plan is to have at least one close
to mindless task in the rotation that can give my mind a break from the current task. I 
plan on trying the following:

Main task: Fix Jack Stand axis coord issues
Secondary task: update documentation on Jack Stands

Maybe these are the only two I will need but I can adjust as the week progresses

## Current Untransfered information

- Setting micro step resolution on STM from pi software, [[2024-04-15]]
- Adding protections for theta axis in JS controller, [[2024-04-24]]
- Changed how the JS controller calculates the correct speeds and accels for axis
coordination
- Changing how TIM5 on the STM32 is used to control the stepping pulses

## Transfered Information



## Final Notes and Analysis

This week was fairly slow for developement, but I got a key element of the truss system
working finally. The ability of the 3 axes on the Jack Stands to coordinate together is
pivitol to ensure that the neither the stands nor the wood are damaged during the
construction process.

There is still one key element missing. Trever pointed out that if I am to properly
coordinate the stands together I will need to properly set the speeds of the stands in
the orchestrator script. As of now, I have been assuming that all members of a truss 
will be symetrically supported. This is an unreasonable assumption due to the very
nature of truss structures. I will need to brainstorm ideas for how to properly
calculate.
