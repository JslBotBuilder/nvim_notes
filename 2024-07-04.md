## Current Tasks

- run final angle test on Jack Stand Orchestrator
- add optimal Jack Stand placement constraint to Jack Stand Planner
- add nail plate visualization to Jack Stand Planner

## Notes and Observations

1. The angular tests for the Jack Stand Orchestrator are finally complete! The results
are fairly promising. After 30 trials, the orchestrator was able to coordinate two Jack
Stands to move a truss member very small angles (1.0 and 0.5 degrees) with approximatly
0.005 degrees of error on average.

2. Although the final angle tests were able to be performed on the orchestrator software
successfully, a troubling set of bugs were observed. During some of the Jack Stand's
motions, the tracker ball on one of the Jack Stands became occluded and resulted in the
stand vanishing from the tracking software. This caused a couple of motion errors while 
testing. On ocassion, the jack stand that kept phasing in and out of existence would 
move further than it was commanded to and, in some cases, wouldn't move at all. This 
caused no permanent problems but it does highlight some of the issues that come with the
Jack Stand system's feedforward control implementation.

## Accomplished Goals

- add plate information reader to truss_reader
- run final angle test on Jack Stand Orchestrator
