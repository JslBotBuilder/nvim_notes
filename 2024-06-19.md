## Current Tasks

- figure out how to make occupancy map for intermode mobile robots

## Notes and Observations

1. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to implement the lidar myself, as the intermode 
doesn't include any of it's own implementations.

## Accomplished Goals

- run accuracy tests on Jack Stand Orchestrator implementations
- document and record accuracy tests
