## Current Tasks

- Fix theta and translational axes coordination math issues
- Move on to STM controll scheme or mobile robots

## Notes and Observations

1. After examining the stepping square waves for the Jack Stand axes on the logic 
analyzer, I realized that I've been looking at the wrong problem this whole time.

The motors were never starting at different times. They were only ending at different 
times. This can only mean one thing: my coordination math was wrong from the very start.
I will need to recalculate the speeds and accelerations again and be far more careful
this time.

## Accomplished Goals

- No accomplished tasks
Progress was made on the fixing of the stand axes (as in the real problem was more or 
less identified) but the problem is still not fixed.
