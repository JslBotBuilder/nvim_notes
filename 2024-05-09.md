## Current Tasks

- Test JS orchestrator
- Rewire Jack Stands with new extension board

## Notes and Observations

1. I found the cause the a majority of the remaining timing error in the Jack Stand 
firmware. It appears that the frequency TIM1 was refreshing and calling it's period 
elapsed callback was too high. The interrupt was being called so frequently that it was 
affecting the performance of the rest of the main execution loop. I remedied this by 
tuning the pre-scaller value to allow the time elapsed callback to be called less 
frequently.

## Accomplished Goals

- Reduced timing error of Jack Stand axis control
