## Weekly Overview

This week the primary objective is to document the current version of the Jack Stand
Controller software and perform other refinement tasks on the Jack Stand portion of the
truss system. 

Once the boards that Matthew made arrive, I will rewire the stands and test the board's
functionality. If all goes well, all should be finished by the end of this week.

## Primary Goals
- Update documentation on Jack Stand Controller
- Refine documenting workflow
- Make task rotation for productivity improvement
- Test JS Orchestrator with new JS firmware
- Edit orchestrator to perfrom speed scalling for the Jack Stands

## Secondary Goals
- Get back to mobile robots
- Edit branch of Jack stand firmware to work with Matthew's JS board
