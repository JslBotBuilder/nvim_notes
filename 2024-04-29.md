## Current Tasks

- Narrow down JS axis coordination issue
- Implement fix for JS axis coordination issue

## Notes and Observations

1. Today's tracking of the JS axis coordination problem:

- Changing the STM to calculate the time delay based on known units of command speed
can be better for known how to set the speed and accel and removing ambiguity from the
system.

Switching the STM time delay calculation to (1/cmd_speed) * msr. This will hopefully be
a more reliable calculation.

2. I spoke with Barett today and we may be in dire straights with the Jack Stands. It 
re-iterated the problem I stated before: this segment of JS developement has taken far 
too long. I'm almost at my wit's end with these devices. It seems as though the longer
I spend developing the software for these devices the more ways they find to break. I 
need upgrades, and I need them fast. I'm now on a 2 week deadline. If I cannot get these
blasted stands working flawlessly by then, I'll have no choice but to revert back to the
Teknic motors. Though I have very limited justifications (motor latency, pi latency, 
size. I need to get better at explaining these), It would be a devastating blow to the 
project to have to revert. I have a couple action items that may improve the stands
enough to avoid this:

- Get Matthew to make a simple connection board
- Look into time optimal analysis for solving the motion for the Jack Stands
- Look into RUCKIG or Moveit for motion planning implementations
- Move to a separate working stand until functionality can be verified(and circuit 
quality of life can be improved)

3. After doing a quick readup on Ruckig and Moveit. Moveit may be the only feasible
option to replace my current hand calculated method of moving the Jack Stands

## Accomplished Goals

- No accomplished tasks

Progress was made in finding alternatives to the Jack Stand coordination problem, but 
unfortunately Jack Stand 4 is now non-functional. I'm now down to 2 stands that I know
work.
