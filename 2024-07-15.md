## Current Tasks

- add optimal Jack Stand placement constraint to Jack Stand Planner
- add nail plate visualization to Jack Stand Planner
- call Momin from wheel.me
- call Jack about algorithm for press robot reach characterization

## Notes and Observations

1. Momin notes

- Footprint
    - the protrusion is tracked as an offset not as part of the robot
    - the protrusion does not ignore lidar data and will still respond to any objects
      that are within that area and treat it like a collision (not good)
- RGo
    - improved mapping made by wheel.me
    - learns the map that makes dynamic changes to occupancy map
    - only mapping improvements

2. Truss meeting notes
    - Goal for optimizing the placement of stands should still be the number of stands
    - There should be a constraint on the moment that needs to be applied, both from
      pressing on webs and on chord ends, to reduce crown. The constraint should be that
      the stands cannot be allowed to apply less than a given moment.
    - The previous constraint should also be applied when it comes to the force that
      must be applied to reduce bow.

3. Primary constraint edit. It seems as though the way to encapsulate the moment and 
arm forces within a constraint is to set a minimum distance constraint between a Jack
Stand and a joint and set a minimum distance between two individual jack stands (more 
so for the case of two jack stands). This will give good enough positions for the stands
when simply optimizing the number of stands with the constraints.

The equation in question is significantly longer and more painful than I could have
anticipated, but use it we must so use it we will. There are a large number of variables
that will be needed to implement the specific constraint needed for the two stand 
scenario. The most difficult of these to obtain, of course, it the length from the end
at which the stands are positioned. After a bit of thinking and searching, there is an
encapsulated method I can make to potentially satisfy the constraint definition inputs
without breaking the whole solver. But using the `islice` method of `itertools` package
I can make a function that I can call on the spot when I need the index of the nth 
appearance of a variable within a list. Getting the rest of the values needed for the
constraint will hopefully be easier, but that remains to be seen.

4. I need to ask whether the jaws of the Jack Stand are big enough to accept even the 
highest level of crowning in wooden members.

Update: Yes it is

## Accomplished Goals
