## Current Tasks

- add optimal Jack Stand placement constraint to Jack Stand Planner
- add nail plate visualization to Jack Stand Planner
- call Momin from wheel.me
- call Jack about algorithm for press robot reach characterization

## Notes and Observations

1. Momin notes

- Footprint
    - the protrusion is tracked as an offset not as part of the robot
    - the protrusion does not ignore lidar data and will still respond to any objects
      that are within that area and treat it like a collision (not good)
- RGo
    - improved mapping made by wheel.me
    - learns the map that makes dynamic changes to occupancy map
    - only mapping improvements

2. Truss meeting notes
    - Goal for optimizing the placement of stands should still be the number of stands
    - There should be a constraint on the moment that needs to be applied, both from
      pressing on webs and on chord ends, to reduce crown. The constraint should be that
      the stands cannot be allowed to apply less than a given moment.
    - The previous constraint should also be applied when it comes to the force that
      must be applied to reduce bow.


## Accomplished Goals

- call Momin from wheel.me
