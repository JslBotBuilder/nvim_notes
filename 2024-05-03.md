## Current Tasks

- Test JS axis coordination fix

## Notes and Observations

1. I finally found the problem that was causing the JS axis coordination issue. The
timer I was using to keep track of the timings for all motors was being improperly used.
Each time I incremented the time trackers for the motors, I reset the counter back to 0.
This cause me to loose significant time and performance from the internal timer (TIM5 in
this case). I've redone the pulse timer tracking to eliminate this issue. There is still
a small delay during large movements, but this should have virtually no effect on the 
performance of the Jack Stands.

2. After performing accuracy tests on the x-axis of the JS with the newly implemented 
timer control, I got an average positional accuracy of 0.1503mm. The max error I got in
any of my trials was 0.23mm.
