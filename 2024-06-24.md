## Current Tasks

- run final angle test on Jack Stand Orchestrator
- re-familiarize with jack stand planner software
- plan out Jack Stand Planner software changes and modifications

## Notes and Observations

1. Barret wants me to go back to the Jack Stand planner and update it, as well as add 
heavily modify its functionality. I will make this the new top priority

2. Concerning the Jack Stand Planner. For now I should simply focus on marking the 
joints that would be inaccessible in the final graphic that the planner displays. It 
looks as if it will simply be a separate process than the Jack Stand placements.

3. After contemplating the problem, I believe that if I am able to get my hands on the 
nail plate corner point information, I will greatly simply the problem of assesing
whether a joint is accessible to the press robot or not. The trs files that I've been
using thus far do not have this information. However, I know that the major truss 
manufacturers do store this information, as they use it for laser guidance features on 
their manual build tables. I have no clue yet how I'm going to obtain this information 
or if it will even be accessible to me for the majority of truss builds.

## Accomplished Goals
