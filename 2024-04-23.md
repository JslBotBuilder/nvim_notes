## Current Tasks

- Fix axis coordination bug on JS controller
- Think about whether STM controll scheme must be redone
- Test JS orchestrator to test effectiveness
- Move on to STM controll scheme or mobile robots

## Notes and Observations

1. The axis coordination bug that was occuring in the JS controller was not the result
of a bug in software. It was the result of the controller properly calculating the
speeds and accelerations it needed to allow all axes to reach the goal point at the same
time at the speed and accel given by the service client. This resulted in the theta axis
attempting to move at extremely high speeds to keep up with the x and y axis, which
would take a very short amount of time to reach their goal if it was already relatively
close.

2. I will need to build in protections to prevent the axes from traveling at too high
speeds.

## Accomplished Goals

- Fix axis coordination bug on JS controller
- Think about whether STM control scheme must be redone
