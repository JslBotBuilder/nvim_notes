## Current Tasks

- Fix axis coordination bug on JS controller
- Think about whether STM controll scheme must be redone
- Test JS orchestrator to test effectiveness
- Move on to STM controll scheme or mobile robots
- Make control diagram for JS firmware
- Calculate loop rate of JS firmware

## Notes and Observations

1. JS axes still begin their motions at separate times. The reason this occurs is still
unclear but must be dealt with. If no feasible solution can be found soon, then I will
be forced to make re-doing the STM control scheme immediately. As of now, fixing this bug
is top priority.

2. Axis testing has gone too poorly for me to make any conclusions. I will need the 
3D scanner to fully measure positional accuracy of the stands.

## Accomplished Goals

- Make Control diagram for JS firmware
- Calculate loop rate of JS firmware
