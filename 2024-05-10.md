## Current Tasks

- Test JS orchestrator
- Rewire Jack Stands with new extension board

## Notes and Observations

1. I'm going to have to put the orchestration tests and JS rewirings on hold for now.
The voltare is incacable of producing boards of sufficient quality and function to meet
our needs for cleaning up the JS wiring.

2. The current functions of the Jack Stand Controller have undergone a significant 
amount of refinement in the past couple months, but it still lacks a few vital features.
After thinking through the needs of the Jack Stand Orchestrator, there are a few 
pressing needs that must be met:

- A heartbeat for each Jack Stand so that the orchestrator can know which stands are
active and able to be used and which are not.
- A way to monitor battery life of the Jack Stand to know whether it must be swapped out
and charged.

The orchestrator also needs additional functionality as discussed in previous notes. It 
must calculate what speeds to command the Jack Stands at based on which axis has the 
largest move.

## Accomplished Goals

- Improved Jack Stand axis coordination timing
