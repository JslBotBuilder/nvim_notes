## Current Tasks

- Narrow down JS axis coordination issue
- Test JS axis coordination fix

## Notes and Observations

1. I may have overlooked the simplest method to coordinate the movement between axes.
By simply scaling the given velocity and acceleration by motor motion ratios, I should
be able to skip the complicated math altogether. The motion ratios will have the highest
movement as the base for the percentage calculations (i.e. 100%) and scale down the 
speed information of the other axes based on what percentage they are of the largest 
movement.
