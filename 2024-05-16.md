## Current Tasks

- Implement speed scalling on Jack Stand Orchestrator
- Assembled the rest of the Jack Stand breakout boards
- Test New Jack Stand Circuitry
- Add truss dockerization to current implementation of docker-config

## Notes and Observations

1. The problem seems to be with the encoders of the Jack Stand being undervolted with 
the new board. Hopefully solving that will cause it to work.

2. I should update my dockerization tooling to the currently used implementations. I can
simply take the current master branch and make a few small folders for truss docker
files.
