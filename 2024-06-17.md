## Current Tasks

- figure out how to make occupancy map for intermode mobile robots
- run accuracy tests on Jack Stand Orchestrator implementations
- document and record accuracy tests

## Notes and Observations

1. It would appear as though the NVIDIA Orin boards on the intermodes aren't turning on.
I currently have no idea why this would be the case given that I haven't touched the 
circuitry on either bases. What's even stranger is that this is occuring for both bases,
which means it most certainly isn't a circuit change.
