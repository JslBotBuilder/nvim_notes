## Current Tasks

- Edit trinamic control board to allow for testing on single axis tester
- Fix angular movement bug on jack_stand_controller

## Notes and Observations

1. In attempting to find the nvim controlls for making, moving, 
and switching between the terminal windows I've found this note pad! Very useful and easily accessible.
This will be my most direct interface between my streams of thought and direct documentation.

2. I have now figured out how to access my entire undo tree! It will be good to take note of this
for future reference.

3. I have now figured out how create and destroy windows with the nvim plugins I've gathered.
The shortcut to all commands I need can easily be found by using <crtl-w>. Unfortunatly,
This technique does not work for opened terminal windows.

## Accomplished Goals

- Fixed angular movment bug on jack_stand_controller
