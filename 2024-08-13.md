## Current Tasks

- get lidars working on intermode mobile base
- add spi amplifier boards to jack stand
- fix truss reader to account for new errors with multi truss TPS files
- track down source of floor truss member positioning error

## Notes and Observations

1. Speed Demon notes:
    - goal: make robot's faster
    - metrics for speed. Lineal feet (of wall made per day)
    - making the robots flashier is an additional objective to robot improvement
    - current robot build speed is relatively independent of panel complexity (however,
    we can only build blank panels)
    - think about what computing the panel system performs that can be pre-calcualated
    and cached
    - think about what processes can be parrallelized during the build to save time
    - think about what other aspects can speed up the build and or make it flashier
    - think about what processes in the build can be abstracted out and tested 
    individually for speed
    - time profiling exists for each of the steps in a schedule and manual profiling 
    exists to time subprocesses within those steps
    - profiling will be done on 3161 robots
