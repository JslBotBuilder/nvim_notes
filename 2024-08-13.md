## Current Tasks

- get lidars working on intermode mobile base
- add spi amplifier boards to jack stand
- fix truss reader to account for new errors with multi truss TPS files
- track down source of floor truss member positioning error

## Notes and Observations

1. Speed Demon notes:
    - goal: make robot's faster
    - metrics for speed. Lineal feet (of wall made per day)
    - making the robots flashier is an additional objective to robot improvement
    - current robot build speed is relatively independent of panel complexity (however,
    we can only build blank panels)
    - think about what computing the panel system performs that can be pre-calcualated
    and cached
    - think about what processes can be parrallelized during the build to save time
    - think about what other aspects can speed up the build and or make it flashier
    - think about what processes in the build can be abstracted out and tested 
    individually for speed
    - time profiling exists for each of the steps in a schedule and manual profiling 
    exists to time subprocesses within those steps
    - profiling will be done on 3161 robots
    - one point of contension that was not addressed in our meeting was the errors the
    panel system experiences. This is perhaps one of the biggest contributors to wasted
    time on the system. Though it may not be taken well, fixing these is a sure-fire way
    of improving the speed of the panel system

2. Profiling tools for C++:
    - Tracy: looks nice! gives function names with run times
    - Remotery: real time. gives function names. viewer runs in web browser
    - Orbit: real time, must catch process while running 

## Accomplished Goals

- track down source of floor truss member positioning error
- fix truss reader to account for new errors with multi truss TPS files
